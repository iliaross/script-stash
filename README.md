## Script Stash

A collection of useful scripts for sysadmin tasks, automation, and everyday problem-solving. This is my personal toolbox of utilities I built over time.

### Scripts

#### Perl Scripts

- **check-apache-vhosts.pl**  
  Tests Apache virtual host configurations by enabling them one by one and verifying the configuration remains valid

#### Bash Scripts

_(Coming soon)_

### Requirements

Scripts might have different dependencies. Check the comments at the top of each script for any specific requirements.

### Contributing
